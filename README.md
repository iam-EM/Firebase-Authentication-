# Firebase Authentication Project

## Overview

This project aims to implement Firebase authentication, allowing users to log in using their Google account, email, and password. The project will be updated regularly to improve functionality and add new features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Firebase Account**: You need a Firebase account to set up authentication and store user data securely.
  - Sign up for Firebase at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Firebase Configuration

1. **Set up a Firebase Project:**
   - Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   
2. **Add Firebase to your Web App:**
   - In the Firebase Console, obtain your Firebase project's configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.).
   - Replace the placeholders in `src/index.js` with your Firebase project configuration.

   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   };
